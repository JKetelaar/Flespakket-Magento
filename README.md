# Flespakket for Magento

This is the edited version of Flespakket, made by [JKetelaar](http://www.jketelaar.nl/ "Website").

This system is mostly meant to let the user interact less with the website, just as the user should do. The plugin calculates the amount of bottles in a package that is needed and also calculates the amount of packages it needs for the bought bottles.

Example
> Customer buys 21 bottles. With the default plugin you would need to set the box to 'anders', but with this system the administartor doesn't even need to select a box. The system calculates that you need two packages, one with 18 bottles and one with 6 bottles. It chooses the 6 bottle package, because that's the package that's the closest to the 5 bottles, since there are no packages with 5 bottles. Now the user only needs to press the send to flespakket button and the correct information will be send to the flespakket server. That's it!

### Installation

You do not need any other plugins to get this plugin to work.

The installation works like the default flespakket plugin for Magento.
If you do not know how the default one works, then please head to the flespakket site and request their installation package for Magento.
